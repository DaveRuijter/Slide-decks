# Slide-decks

In this repository you will find all slide decks and additional material (like scripts, demo files etc) for the sessions I have presented at various events around the world. Folders are broken up in years, in which you will find the event folder. Every event folder is setup as follows; _YYYY-MM-DD_EventName_Location_. Location could either be online or the on site location where the event was hosted. 

In case you want to know more about the sessions, looking for session abstracts or my speaker profile, please find my [Sessionize profile](https://sessionize.com/marclelijveld) which includes all this. 

All material is created by myself, or otherwise refered to original owners of material. Scripts and demo files can be reused for own non-comercial purpose, with reference to the original owner. For further questions, please reach out by creating an issue.
